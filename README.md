## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP EXAMPLE
- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to interact with the page

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- Add localStorage or firebase for storage

## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router, Nav, Main, and Footer components| 
| Nav | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Main | This will be the main section or a Home page and include Overview, SearchForm, and StateInfo components| 
| About | This will render the about section | 
| Footer | This will render the footer that will appear in all pages | 
| Overview | This will render the overview statistics of COVID-19 in the US | 
| SearchForm | This will render the search form to search stats for a particular state | 
| StateInfo | This will render the statistics of COVID-19 in inputted state | 


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Create components and export/import among files| H | 1hr| hr | hr |
| Set up React Routing | H | 20min| hrs | hrs |
| NavBar and Footer | H | 1.5hr| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Research COVID-19 and write About component | H | 1.5hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| main - make API call and pass down data | H | 2hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| make searchForm | H | 2.5hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| make state&function to pass up user input | H | 1.5hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| create stateInfo component | H | 2hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 4hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Basic Styling for nav, footer, about page | H | 2hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Basic Styling for main | H | 2hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Additional Styling for the page | M | 4hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 24hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project such as Axios, ReactStrap, D3, etc. 

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description.  Code snippet should not be greater than 10 lines of code. 

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```
