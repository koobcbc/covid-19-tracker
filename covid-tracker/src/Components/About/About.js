                <h2>What is COVID-19?</h2>
                <p>COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. COVID-19 is now a pandemic affecting many countries globally.</p>
                <p>Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.</p>
                <br/>
                <h2>How does it spread?</h2>
                <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.</p>
                <br/>
